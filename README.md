# Learning Testing Repository

Welcome to my **Learning Testing** repository! ðŸ§ªâœ…

## Purpose
This repository is a collection of notes, tips, and examples related to software testing. Itâ€™s designed to help me learn and understand different testing concepts, techniques, and tools.

## What's Inside
- **Notes** - Key concepts, terminology, and explanations about testing.
- **Code Examples** - Snippets to demonstrate testing techniques and frameworks.
- **Tips** - Best practices and common pitfalls to avoid in testing.

## Why This Repo?
I wanted a dedicated space to document and organize everything Iâ€™m learning about software testing. This makes it easier to review and apply the knowledge in real projects.

Feel free to explore and use any content you find helpful. Iâ€™m also open to suggestions on how to improve this repository or add new content.
